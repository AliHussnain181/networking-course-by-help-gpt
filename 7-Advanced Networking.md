## What is a VLAN?

A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical subdivision of a physical network. VLANs allow network administrators to create separate networks within the same physical infrastructure, enabling devices in different VLANs to communicate as if they are on different physical networks.

**Example:**
- **VLAN 10** could be used for the Sales department.
- **VLAN 20** could be used for the Engineering department.
- Devices in VLAN 10 can communicate with each other, while devices in VLAN 20 can communicate among themselves, regardless of their physical location.

## Benefits of VLANs

- **Improved Security:** VLANs help isolate sensitive data traffic. For example, the finance department can be segmented from the rest of the organization, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Better Performance:** By reducing broadcast domains, VLANs can limit unnecessary traffic on a network, improving overall performance.
- **Simplified Management:** VLANs allow for easier management of devices based on their roles rather than their physical locations. This simplifies changes and configurations when users or devices move.
- **Scalability:** As organizations grow, VLANs allow easy addition or removal of devices without needing extensive rewiring or changes to physical infrastructure.

## VLAN Tagging

To identify which VLAN a frame belongs to, VLAN tagging is used. The most common standard for VLAN tagging is IEEE 802.1Q.

### How 802.1Q Works

1. When a frame is sent from a device, a VLAN tag is added to the Ethernet frame.
2. This tag contains:
   - **VLAN ID:** A unique identifier for the VLAN (1-4095).
   - **Priority:** An optional field for Quality of Service (QoS).

### Example of VLAN Tagging

- An Ethernet frame from a computer in VLAN 10 would be tagged with `0x8100` (the EtherType for 802.1Q) followed by the VLAN ID.

## Types of VLANs

1. **Data VLAN:** Used for user data traffic, segregating user devices based on their functional roles.
2. **Voice VLAN:** Dedicated to voice traffic, allowing better management and prioritization of VoIP communications.
3. **Management VLAN:** Used for managing network devices, ensuring that management traffic is separate from user data.
4. **Native VLAN:** The default VLAN for untagged frames on a trunk port. Any untagged frames received on a trunk port are assigned to the native VLAN.

## What is Trunking?

Trunking is a method used to allow multiple VLANs to traverse a single physical link (trunk link) between switches or routers. This is essential in larger networks where VLANs are deployed to maintain logical separation while minimizing the need for additional physical connections.

### How Trunking Works

1. **Trunk Ports:** Switch ports configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs. They use VLAN tagging to identify frames belonging to different VLANs.
2. **Allowed VLANs:** Administrators can configure trunk ports to allow only specific VLANs to pass through, enhancing security and performance.

### Example of Trunking

If two switches (Switch A and Switch B) are connected via a trunk link, traffic from VLAN 10, VLAN 20, and VLAN 30 can all travel over this single link. Each frame will be tagged with its respective VLAN ID.

## VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)

VTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to manage VLANs across a network of switches. It helps in the automatic propagation of VLAN information across switches.

### VTP Modes

1. **Server Mode:** The switch can create, delete, and modify VLANs for the entire VTP domain. This mode is usually used for core switches.
2. **Client Mode:** The switch cannot create or delete VLANs but can use VLAN information provided by VTP servers.
3. **Transparent Mode:** The switch does not participate in VTP but can forward VTP advertisements.

### VTP Domain

All switches in a VTP domain share the same VLAN information. Each switch must be configured with the same domain name for proper communication.

## Configuring VLANs and Trunking

### Step 1: Create VLANs

1. Access the switchâ€™s command line interface (CLI).
2. Enter configuration mode.

```bash
enable
configure terminal
```

3. Create VLANs.

```bash
vlan 10
name Sales
exit

vlan 20
name Engineering
exit
```

### Step 2: Assign VLANs to Ports

Assign specific switch ports to VLANs.

```bash
interface range fa0/1 - 24
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
```

### Step 3: Configure Trunking

Configure trunk ports to allow multiple VLANs.

```bash
interface fa0/24
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
```

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

Check the VLAN configuration and trunking status:

```bash
show vlan brief
show interfaces trunk
```

---

## Conclusion

Virtual LANs (VLANs) and trunking are essential concepts in modern networking, allowing for logical segmentation of networks while minimizing the use of physical resources. By implementing VLANs, network administrators can enhance security, manageability, and performance. Trunking enables efficient communication between VLANs over single physical links, facilitating a scalable network design. Understanding and effectively configuring these technologies is vital for maintaining robust and efficient network infrastructures.

### Quality of Service (QoS) and Traffic Shaping

Quality of Service (QoS) and traffic shaping are essential concepts in networking that ensure the efficient management of network resources and optimal performance for various types of traffic. These techniques are crucial for maintaining the reliability and performance of applications, particularly in environments where bandwidth is limited or shared.

## What is Quality of Service (QoS)?

Quality of Service (QoS) refers to the set of techniques and technologies used to manage network resources by prioritizing certain types of traffic. QoS aims to ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency while preventing less important traffic from degrading the performance of essential services.

### Key Goals of QoS

1. **Minimize Latency:** Reduce the time it takes for data packets to travel from the source to the destination.
2. **Reduce Jitter:** Ensure that the delay between data packets is consistent, particularly important for real-time applications like VoIP and video conferencing.
3. **Guarantee Bandwidth:** Ensure that critical applications have enough bandwidth to function properly, especially during peak usage times.
4. **Prevent Packet Loss:** Minimize the loss of packets, which can occur due to congestion in the network.

## Key QoS Concepts

1. **Traffic Classification:** Identifying and categorizing different types of traffic based on protocols, applications, or other parameters.
2. **Traffic Prioritization:** Assigning priority levels to different types of traffic, ensuring that high-priority traffic is processed before lower-priority traffic.
3. **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Formal agreements between service providers and customers that specify the expected level of service, including performance metrics like bandwidth, latency, and uptime.

## QoS Mechanisms

Several mechanisms are employed to implement QoS in a network:

1. **Queuing:** Different types of traffic are placed in different queues, allowing the network device to handle higher-priority traffic first. Common queuing mechanisms include:
   - **Priority Queuing (PQ):** High-priority traffic is processed before lower-priority traffic.
   - **Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ):** Each traffic class is assigned a weight, and bandwidth is allocated accordingly.

2. **Traffic Policing:** Monitoring and regulating the traffic flow in a network. If the traffic exceeds a specified rate, packets may be dropped or marked for lower priority.

3. **Traffic Shaping:** Smoothing out bursts of traffic by controlling the rate at which packets are sent, thereby improving the overall traffic flow.

4. **Packet Marking:** Adding metadata to packets to indicate their priority level. Common marking protocols include:
   - **Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP):** Used to classify packets for different QoS levels.
   - **IP Precedence:** An older method of classifying IP packets for QoS.

## What is Traffic Shaping?

Traffic shaping is a network management technique that controls the amount and rate of traffic sent to and from the network. It aims to smooth out the data flow, ensuring that bursts of traffic do not overwhelm the network and lead to congestion. Traffic shaping is often used in conjunction with QoS policies to optimize network performance.

### Benefits of Traffic Shaping

- **Improved Network Performance:** By smoothing out traffic bursts, traffic shaping helps maintain consistent network performance.
- **Effective Bandwidth Utilization:** Ensures that available bandwidth is used effectively without overwhelming the network.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides a better experience for users by minimizing latency and packet loss.

## Traffic Shaping Techniques

1. **Leaky Bucket Algorithm:** This technique uses a "bucket" that fills up with incoming packets. The bucket leaks at a constant rate, allowing packets to exit gradually. If the bucket overflows, packets are dropped.

2. **Token Bucket Algorithm:** Similar to the leaky bucket, but it allows bursts of traffic by using tokens. Each token represents permission to send a packet. Tokens are generated at a steady rate, and excess tokens can be used for bursts.

3. **Rate Limiting:** Restricting the bandwidth allocated to specific applications or users. This prevents any single user or application from consuming too much bandwidth and impacting others.

4. **Congestion Avoidance:** Techniques such as Random Early Detection (RED) proactively drop packets before congestion occurs, allowing traffic shaping to react to network conditions effectively.

## Difference Between QoS and Traffic Shaping

| **Aspect**               | **Quality of Service (QoS)**                       | **Traffic Shaping**                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Prioritizes different types of traffic             | Controls the rate of traffic flow                |
| **Implementation**       | Involves various mechanisms like queuing and marking | Uses algorithms like leaky bucket and token bucket |
| **Focus**                | Ensures specific performance levels for applications | Smoothers traffic bursts for consistent performance |
| **Traffic Management**    | Can drop or delay packets based on priority       | Controls how fast packets are sent without dropping them |

## Conclusion

Quality of Service (QoS) and traffic shaping are vital components in modern networking that help manage and optimize network performance. QoS focuses on prioritizing traffic to ensure that critical applications function smoothly, while traffic shaping controls the flow of traffic to prevent congestion. By implementing these techniques, network administrators can improve the reliability, efficiency, and overall user experience of their networks.

## What is Network Monitoring?

Network monitoring involves continuously observing a network for performance issues, security threats, and operational stability. It helps in identifying problems before they affect network performance or user experience.

### Importance of Network Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting is the process of diagnosing and resolving issues that affect the network. Effective troubleshooting can minimize downtime, improve network performance, and enhance user satisfaction. Key benefits include:

- Early detection of issues.
- Faster resolution times.
- Improved network reliability.

## Wireshark

Wireshark is a widely-used network protocol analyzer that captures and inspects packets transmitted over a network. It provides detailed information about network traffic, making it an invaluable tool for network administrators and security professionals.

### Key Features

- **Packet Capture:** Captures live network traffic from various interfaces.
- **Protocol Analysis:** Decodes and analyzes over 1,000 network protocols.
- **Filtering Options:** Allows users to apply filters to focus on specific traffic types.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Provides an intuitive interface for navigating captured data.
- **Export Options:** Allows users to save captures in various formats for later analysis.

### Use Cases

- **Network Troubleshooting:** Identify issues such as packet loss, latency, and connectivity problems.
- **Security Analysis:** Monitor for unauthorized access or unusual traffic patterns.
- **Protocol Development:** Analyze how custom protocols behave over the network.
- **Performance Tuning:** Evaluate network performance and identify bottlenecks.

## Ping

Ping is a simple command-line utility that tests the reachability of a host on a network and measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to the destination.

### How Ping Works

1. **ICMP Echo Request:** When you use the Ping command, it sends an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request to the target IP address.
2. **ICMP Echo Reply:** If the target is reachable, it responds with an ICMP echo reply.
3. **Round-Trip Time:** Ping measures the time it takes for the request to travel to the destination and back.

### Common Use Cases

- **Connectivity Testing:** Determine if a device is reachable on the network.
- **Latency Measurement:** Measure the time it takes to send and receive packets.
- **Troubleshooting:** Identify issues with network paths, such as packet loss or delays.

## Traceroute

Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool that shows the path that packets take from the source to the destination. It provides information about each hop along the route and helps identify where delays or failures occur.

### How Traceroute Works

1. **TTL (Time to Live):** Traceroute sends packets with gradually increasing TTL values (starting at 1). Each router that forwards the packet decrements the TTL value by one.
2. **ICMP Time Exceeded:** When the TTL reaches 0, the router drops the packet and sends back an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message to the source.
3. **Route Mapping:** This process continues until the destination is reached or a specified number of hops is completed, allowing Traceroute to map the route taken by the packets.

### Use Cases

- **Path Analysis:** Understand the route packets take to reach a destination and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Network Troubleshooting:** Identify which hop is causing delays or packet loss.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Assess the performance of network paths over time.

## Conclusion

Network monitoring and troubleshooting are essential components of maintaining a healthy and efficient network. Tools like **Wireshark**, **Ping**, and **Traceroute** provide valuable insights into network performance, helping administrators diagnose issues and optimize network configurations. By utilizing these tools, network professionals can ensure smooth operations and enhance overall user satisfaction.

### Hands-on Lab: VLAN and Network Traffic Analysis

In this lab, you will set up a VLAN environment, configure trunking between switches, and use Wireshark to analyze network traffic for various VLANs. The objective is to understand how VLANs work, how they isolate traffic, and how network traffic behaves when using trunking.

---

### **Lab Requirements**:
- Two or more network switches that support VLANs and 802.1Q trunking (can be physical or virtual using network simulation tools like Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, or EVE-NG).
- End devices (PCs or virtual machines) for testing VLAN communication.
- Wireshark installed on a PC for network traffic analysis.
- Basic knowledge of switch configuration and CLI.

---

### **Lab Setup**

1. **Network Topology**
   - Two network switches connected using a trunk link.
   - Multiple PCs connected to the switches on different VLANs.
   - Wireshark running on one of the PCs for traffic analysis.

   **Topology Diagram**:
   ```
   PC1 (VLAN 10) ---- Switch 1 ---- Trunk ---- Switch 2 ---- PC3 (VLAN 20)
                             |                           |
                           PC2 (VLAN 10)               PC4 (VLAN 30)
   ```

---

### **Step 1: Configure VLANs on Switches**

#### 1.1 Create VLANs on both switches:
   - VLAN 10 for Sales department.
   - VLAN 20 for Engineering department.
   - VLAN 30 for Marketing department.

**Switch 1 and Switch 2 Configuration (CLI)**:
```bash
# Enter global configuration mode
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name Sales
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

Switch(config)# vlan 20
Switch(config-vlan)# name Engineering
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

Switch(config)# vlan 30
Switch(config-vlan)# name Marketing
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
```

#### 1.2 Assign ports to VLANs:
   - Assign access ports to their respective VLANs.
   
```bash
# Example for Switch 1 - PC1 (port 1) in VLAN 10 and PC2 (port 2) in VLAN 10
Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if)# exit

Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/2
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if)# exit

# Repeat for other ports and VLANs as needed
```

---

### **Step 2: Configure Trunk Port Between Switches**

The link between Switch 1 and Switch 2 needs to carry traffic for multiple VLANs, so you must configure it as a trunk port.

#### 2.1 Configure Trunk Port on Switch 1 and Switch 2:

```bash
# Configure trunk on Switch 1 - Interface connected to Switch 2 (e.g., FastEthernet 0/24)
Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/24
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
Switch(config-if)# exit

# Configure trunk on Switch 2 similarly
Switch2(config)# interface fastethernet 0/24
Switch2(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch2(config-if)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
Switch2(config-if)# exit
```

---

### **Step 3: Test VLAN Communication**

1. **Ping Test**:
   - From PC1 (VLAN 10), try pinging PC2 (also in VLAN 10). The ping should succeed because they are in the same VLAN.
   - Ping PC3 (VLAN 20) and PC4 (VLAN 30) from PC1. The ping should fail because they are on different VLANs.

2. **VLAN Isolation**:
   - Test that communication between devices in different VLANs is blocked, demonstrating VLAN segmentation.

---

### **Step 4: Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark**

1. **Install Wireshark** on one of the PCs (e.g., PC1 in VLAN 10).

2. **Capture Traffic**:
   - Open Wireshark and select the interface connected to the network.
   - Start capturing traffic on PC1 while pinging devices in the same and different VLANs.

3. **Analyze VLAN Tags**:
   - In Wireshark, look for **802.1Q** VLAN-tagged frames. These tags will indicate which VLAN the packet belongs to.
   - You should see VLAN IDs attached to packets traveling over the trunk link (between Switch 1 and Switch 2).
   - When PC1 communicates with PC2, observe that packets are sent without a VLAN tag since they are in the same VLAN.
   - When communication is attempted with a device in another VLAN, notice that no response is received.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Network Traffic Behavior**

1. **Understanding VLAN Tags**:
   - The **802.1Q** tag will include information like VLAN ID. In Wireshark, expand the Ethernet frame to view the tag:
     - **TPID (Tag Protocol Identifier)**: Identifies the frame as 802.1Q-tagged.
     - **VID (VLAN ID)**: Shows the VLAN the traffic belongs to.

2. **Broadcast Traffic Isolation**:
   - In VLAN-enabled networks, broadcast traffic (e.g., ARP requests) is confined to its VLAN. Use Wireshark to observe that broadcast packets from PC1 do not reach PC3 or PC4.

---

### **Step 6: Cleanup**

After completing the lab:
- Stop the Wireshark capture and review the captured packets.
- Remove or reset the VLAN configurations on the switches, if needed.

### **Conclusion**
By setting up VLANs and trunking between switches, you have learned how to logically segment a network and carry multiple VLANs over a single trunk link. Youâ€™ve also seen how VLAN traffic is isolated and how VLAN tags work in a network using Wireshark to analyze and visualize network traffic.

### How to monitor VLAN traffic?

Monitoring VLAN traffic is crucial for network performance, security, and troubleshooting. There are several tools and methods available to monitor VLAN traffic, ranging from using built-in switch features to dedicated network monitoring solutions. Hereâ€™s how to monitor VLAN traffic effectively:

### **1. Use Switch Port Mirroring (SPAN)**
Most managed switches support **Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN)** or port mirroring. This feature allows you to mirror traffic from one or more switch ports (including VLANs) to a monitoring port where you can capture and analyze the traffic with tools like Wireshark.

#### **Steps for Monitoring VLAN Traffic Using SPAN:**
1. **Enable SPAN on the Switch**:
   - Identify the VLAN or port you want to monitor.
   - Configure the SPAN session to mirror the traffic from the desired source VLAN or interface to a destination port.

   Example Cisco configuration:
   ```bash
   Switch(config)# monitor session 1 source vlan 10
   Switch(config)# monitor session 1 destination interface fastethernet 0/1
   ```

2. **Connect a Monitoring Device**:
   - Connect a PC or network analyzer to the destination interface (FastEthernet 0/1 in the example).
   - Open Wireshark (or another packet analyzer) to capture the traffic mirrored from VLAN 10.

3. **Analyze Traffic**:
   - Start a capture session and analyze the traffic for performance, troubleshooting, or security monitoring.
   - You can filter by VLAN tags in Wireshark by searching for `vlan.id == 10` to isolate traffic from a specific VLAN.

#### **SPAN Advantages:**
- Easy to configure on most managed switches.
- Doesnâ€™t interrupt normal network operation.
- Provides full visibility into VLAN traffic, including unicast, multicast, and broadcast.

#### **SPAN Limitations:**
- It can overload the monitoring port if too much traffic is mirrored.
- Mirroring traffic from multiple VLANs can consume switch resources.

### **2. Use sFlow or NetFlow**
sFlow and NetFlow are network monitoring protocols that provide traffic flow information from devices like switches and routers.

#### **NetFlow Monitoring:**
- **NetFlow** is a Cisco-developed protocol that monitors IP traffic flows.
- While it doesn't capture every packet like SPAN, it provides detailed statistics about flows, including source/destination IP, port numbers, protocols, and VLAN information.

#### **sFlow Monitoring:**
- **sFlow** provides continuous monitoring of traffic on high-speed networks by sampling packets.
- sFlow includes the ability to monitor traffic within specific VLANs.

#### **Steps for sFlow/NetFlow Monitoring**:
1. **Enable NetFlow/sFlow on the Switch**:
   Configure the switch to export flow data to a collector. In Cisco switches, NetFlow is enabled via the CLI.
   ```bash
   Switch(config)# ip flow-export destination <collector-ip> <port>
   Switch(config)# interface vlan 10
   Switch(config-if)# ip flow ingress
   ```

2. **Set Up a Flow Collector**:
   Install a flow collector (such as SolarWinds, PRTG, or ntop) that receives flow data and provides analysis.

3. **Analyze Flow Data**:
   The flow collector will show insights such as bandwidth usage per VLAN, top talkers in the VLAN, and specific protocols used in VLAN traffic.

#### **Advantages**:
- Provides aggregate information on traffic flows across VLANs.
- Scalable for large networks.
- Low overhead as it doesnâ€™t capture every packet, but samples traffic.

#### **Limitations**:
- Less granular than packet capture.
- Doesnâ€™t provide payload details, only metadata (IP addresses, protocols, ports).

---

### **3. Use a Dedicated Network Monitoring Tool**
Dedicated network monitoring tools, like **Wireshark**, **SolarWinds**, **Zabbix**, or **PRTG Network Monitor**, provide more robust VLAN monitoring capabilities. They can offer real-time and historical data, trend analysis, and alerting based on VLAN traffic.

#### **Steps for Using Network Monitoring Tools**:
1. **Set Up the Monitoring Tool**:
   - Install the monitoring software and configure it to communicate with network devices (e.g., switches, routers).
   
2. **Configure SNMP or Flow Monitoring**:
   - Enable SNMP or flow protocols (NetFlow, sFlow) on your switches to report VLAN traffic data to the monitoring tool.
   - Some tools like PRTG provide a VLAN sensor to track VLAN-specific traffic.

3. **Analyze VLAN Traffic**:
   - Use dashboards and alerts to track traffic trends within VLANs, detect bandwidth issues, and monitor specific protocols or devices within VLANs.
   - These tools provide long-term trend analysis, making it easier to identify patterns and predict potential issues.

#### **Advantages**:
- Provides graphical, real-time, and historical data.
- Centralized monitoring for large networks.
- Can generate alerts based on thresholds (e.g., high traffic in a VLAN).

#### **Limitations**:
- Requires proper configuration and may have licensing costs.
- May require additional hardware (for monitoring probes).

### **4. Use VLAN-Specific Filters in Wireshark**
Wireshark can filter and capture traffic based on VLAN tags, making it an ideal tool for monitoring specific VLAN traffic.

#### **Steps for Using Wireshark**:
1. **Capture VLAN Traffic**:
   - Connect Wireshark to a mirrored port or network tap where VLAN-tagged traffic is present (for example, from a trunk link).

2. **Filter VLAN Traffic**:
   - In Wireshark, apply the filter to isolate traffic for a specific VLAN:
     - Use the filter `vlan.id == 10` to view traffic belonging to VLAN 10.
   - Wireshark will show frames tagged with the specified VLAN ID, allowing you to drill down into the communication between devices within that VLAN.

#### **Advantages**:
- Detailed packet-level analysis.
- Free and widely used.
- Provides deep insight into specific VLAN traffic, including payload details.

#### **Limitations**:
- Resource-intensive for large traffic volumes.
- Requires manual analysis unless automated with scripts or additional tools.

---

### **5. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Monitoring**
SNMP is a protocol used to collect and monitor data from network devices. It can provide statistics like VLAN-specific traffic counters, interface statistics, and bandwidth utilization.

#### **Steps for SNMP Monitoring**:
1. **Enable SNMP on the Switch**:
   - Configure SNMP on the switch and define which VLANs or interfaces you want to monitor.

2. **Use an SNMP Monitoring Tool**:
   - Tools like **Zabbix**, **PRTG**, or **Cacti** can collect and display VLAN-specific traffic using SNMP.
   - These tools poll SNMP agents on switches to collect metrics like packets per VLAN, traffic volume, and interface usage.

3. **Analyze Data**:
   - Monitor the bandwidth usage and traffic patterns in VLANs over time.
   - Set up alerts if traffic thresholds are exceeded in specific VLANs.

#### **Advantages**:
- Lightweight and easy to configure.
- Works well for monitoring device and VLAN-level statistics.

#### **Limitations**:
- SNMP canâ€™t capture full packet details, only traffic counters and general statistics.
- Real-time monitoring is limited to polling intervals.

---

### **Conclusion**
Monitoring VLAN traffic can be done using several methods depending on the level of detail and scale required. For granular packet analysis, **SPAN and Wireshark** are excellent, while **sFlow/NetFlow** is ideal for aggregate flow-based monitoring. Tools like **PRTG**, **SolarWinds**, and **Zabbix** provide comprehensive monitoring for VLAN traffic over time and can issue alerts based on traffic behavior.

Each method has its pros and cons, so the right solution depends on your network size, the level of detail needed, and available resources.

### How do I filter VLANs?

Filtering VLAN traffic, especially in tools like **Wireshark**, allows you to focus on specific VLAN traffic in large network environments. Hereâ€™s how to filter VLAN traffic effectively:

### **1. Filtering VLAN Traffic in Wireshark**

Wireshark is one of the most common tools used to capture and analyze network traffic, including VLAN-tagged frames. VLAN traffic is tagged using the **802.1Q** protocol, which adds a 4-byte header to the Ethernet frame that includes the VLAN ID.

#### **Filtering by Specific VLAN ID**
- In Wireshark, you can use display filters to isolate traffic based on the VLAN ID.
- The most common filter to use is based on the **`vlan.id`** field.

##### **Steps**:
1. **Capture VLAN Traffic**:
   - Start capturing traffic on an interface that sees VLAN-tagged frames (typically a trunk port or a port with SPAN mirroring enabled).

2. **Apply VLAN Filter**:
   - To filter traffic for a specific VLAN, use the following filter in Wireshark's display filter bar:
   
   ```plaintext
   vlan.id == <VLAN_ID>
   ```

   Example: To filter for VLAN 10 traffic:
   ```plaintext
   vlan.id == 10
   ```

3. **View Only VLAN Traffic**:
   - This filter will display only packets tagged with VLAN ID 10. All other VLAN traffic will be hidden.

#### **Filtering Multiple VLANs**
- If you want to filter for multiple VLANs, use the OR (`||`) operator to combine multiple VLAN filters.
  
  Example: To filter for VLANs 10 and 20:
  ```plaintext
  vlan.id == 10 || vlan.id == 20
  ```

#### **Filtering Untagged and VLAN Traffic**
- Sometimes, you may want to see both untagged and VLAN-tagged traffic.
- Use the following filter to capture both:
  
  ```plaintext
  not vlan or vlan.id == <VLAN_ID>
  ```

  Example: To see untagged traffic and VLAN 10 traffic:
  ```plaintext
  not vlan or vlan.id == 10
  ```

#### **Filtering by VLAN Protocol or IP Address**
- Once youâ€™ve filtered by VLAN, you can further refine the search by filtering on protocol (TCP, UDP) or IP addresses.
  
  Example: To filter HTTP traffic on VLAN 10:
  ```plaintext
  vlan.id == 10 && http
  ```

  Example: To filter traffic from IP `192.168.1.1` on VLAN 20:
  ```plaintext
  vlan.id == 20 && ip.src == 192.168.1.1
  ```

#### **Identifying VLAN-Tagged Frames**
- In captured packets, the VLAN tag appears in the Ethernet frame as the **802.1Q** header.
  - Expand the **Ethernet II** section in Wireshark to see the **802.1Q Virtual LAN** header, which contains the **VLAN ID**.

---

### **2. Filtering VLAN Traffic on Switches**

If you need to filter VLAN traffic at the network switch level, you can configure **access control lists (ACLs)** or **VLAN access control** to permit or deny traffic for certain VLANs.

#### **Example: Filtering Traffic on a Cisco Switch**
1. **Create an Access Control List (ACL)**:
   - Define an ACL to filter traffic based on IP address, protocol, or VLAN ID.

   Example: Create an ACL to deny traffic from VLAN 20 to a specific IP address:
   ```bash
   Switch(config)# access-list 100 deny ip 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
   Switch(config)# access-list 100 permit ip any any
   ```

2. **Apply the ACL to a VLAN Interface**:
   - Apply the ACL to the VLANâ€™s routed interface or Layer 3 SVI (Switched Virtual Interface).
   
   Example: Apply ACL 100 to the VLAN 20 interface:
   ```bash
   Switch(config)# interface vlan 20
   Switch(config-if)# ip access-group 100 in
   ```

3. **Monitor and Refine Filtering**:
   - The ACL will now filter the traffic as per the defined rules. You can further modify or create rules for specific VLANs.

---

### **3. Filtering VLAN Traffic with sFlow/NetFlow**
If youâ€™re using a flow-based monitoring tool like **sFlow** or **NetFlow**, you can filter and analyze traffic based on VLANs.

- **sFlow**: Monitors traffic by sampling packets, including VLAN-tagged traffic.
- **NetFlow**: Monitors traffic flows and can report statistics on VLAN IDs.

#### Example of Filtering VLAN in sFlow:
- sFlow collectors (such as **ntopng** or **InMon sFlowTrend**) allow you to filter traffic by VLAN ID when visualizing flow data.
- Most flow collectors will allow you to specify the VLAN as part of the query, either using GUI filters or specific queries like:

  ```plaintext
  vlan == 10
  ```

- Tools like **SolarWinds**, **PRTG**, and **ManageEngine NetFlow Analyzer** also allow filtering flows by VLAN ID in a similar manner.

---

### **4. Using SNMP for VLAN Monitoring**

With **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**, you can monitor traffic statistics specific to each VLAN without packet-level inspection.

1. **Enable SNMP on Network Devices**:
   - Make sure SNMP is enabled on your switch and configured to collect data for VLAN interfaces.

2. **Use an SNMP Monitoring Tool**:
   - Tools like **Zabbix**, **PRTG**, or **Cacti** can monitor VLAN-specific interfaces (like the VLAN SVI) for statistics like bandwidth utilization and traffic volume.

3. **Filter VLAN Data**:
   - In the SNMP monitoring tool, filter or create views for VLAN-specific interfaces to track performance or usage.

---

### **5. Filtering VLANs in Router or Firewall Rules**

If you are using Layer 3 switches, routers, or firewalls that route traffic between VLANs, you can set up policies to filter traffic between VLANs.

#### Example: Filtering VLAN Traffic on a Router
1. **Create Firewall Rules**:
   - Define rules to block or allow traffic between VLANs based on the source/destination VLAN or IP address.
   
   Example: Allow only HTTP traffic between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20:
   ```bash
   ip access-list extended VLAN_10_20
   permit tcp any any eq 80
   deny ip any any
   ```

2. **Apply Rules to the VLAN Interface**:
   - Apply the access list to the VLAN interface, limiting inter-VLAN communication.

---

### **Conclusion**
Filtering VLAN traffic can be done at different layers depending on your use case. Tools like **Wireshark** allow deep packet-level inspection, while network switches and routers provide VLAN filtering at the device level through ACLs or flow-based monitoring. Each method provides different insights, ranging from packet-level analysis to broader traffic flow statistics, making VLAN filtering flexible and adaptable to your needs.
