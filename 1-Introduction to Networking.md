### Understanding Network Topologies: Star, Bus, Ring, and Mesh

**Network topology** refers to the arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a computer network. The choice of topology affects the performance, reliability, and scalability of the network. There are various types of topologies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The four most common topologies are **Star**, **Bus**, **Ring**, and **Mesh**.

---

### 1. Star Topology

**Definition:**
In a **Star topology**, all devices (nodes) are connected to a central hub or switch. The hub acts as a repeater for data and helps prevent data collisions.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Centralized Control:** The central hub manages communication between devices.
- **Point-to-Point Connection:** Each device has a dedicated connection to the hub.
- **If the hub fails, the entire network is affected.**

**Advantages:**

- **Failure Isolation:** If one device or its connection fails, it does not affect the entire network.
- **Scalability:** Easy to expand by adding more devices to the central hub.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Single Point of Failure:** The central hub is critical; if it fails, the entire network goes down.
- **Expensive:** Requires more cable than some other topologies, as each device needs a separate connection to the hub.
  
**Use Cases:**
- Common in **home networks** and **small business networks**.
- Suitable for **Wi-Fi networks** where the router acts as the central hub.

---

### 2. Bus Topology

**Definition:**
In a **Bus topology**, all devices are connected to a single communication line, or "bus." Each device communicates via the bus, and data sent by one device is available to all devices.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Single Cable (Bus):** One main cable runs through the network, and all devices are connected to it.
